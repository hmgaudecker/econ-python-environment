Git
=========

On **Windows**, get the latest versions of msysgit: http://msysgit.github.io and TortoiseGit: http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Download. After installing, you should see a couple of additional items ("Git Bash", "TortoiseGit ...", ...) in the context menu when right-clicking on a folder in the Windows explorer.

On **MacOS**, download and install Git from here: http://git-scm.com/download/mac. I very much recommend to install the command-line auto-completion script, as described here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks#Auto-Completion. See :ref:`macos_path_permanent` for modifying the ``.bash_profile`` file.

Just use your package manager on **Linux**.
