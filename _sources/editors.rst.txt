Editors
=========

A good editor is the Swiss Army knife of any serious programmer: It can do almost anything and makes you much more productive. The built-in ones are not an option.

I personally use `Sublime Text <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`_. If you are reading this because you are about to attend my `Effective Programming Practices for Economists <http://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/teaching.html#effective-programming-practices-for-economists-msc-phd>`_ course, I suggest you to try it out for the time being. It is free to try out for a while and it will make it easier for you to follow my live coding.

Modern open source alternatives are `Light Table <http://www.lighttable.com/>`_ or `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_, Emacs and Vim are Unix classics that will stay around among power users. They are certainly not for the faint of heart, though.
