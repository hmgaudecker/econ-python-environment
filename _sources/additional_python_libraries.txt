Additional Python libraries
=============================

In order to obtain a recent development version of `statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/>`_, type::

    conda update -c https://conda.anaconda.org/statsmodels statsmodels

If you need the bootstrap for your standard errors or you are going to estimate ARCH models, I recommend `Kevin Sheppard <http://www.kevinsheppard.com>`_'s `arch <https://github.com/bashtage/arch>`_ package::

    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/bashtage arch

The last time I checked, this only worked for Windows and Linux. Check https://github.com/bashtage/arch for other options.

Note that the bootstrap implementation is by no means specific to ARCH models. For completenes, here are links to `documentation <http://arch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/bootstrap/background.html>`_ and `examples <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bashtage/arch/blob/master/examples/bootstrap_examples.ipynb>`_.

We also need to install a couple of more libraries. Type::

    conda install coverage
    pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex

.. note::

    **Students who only follow the Microeconometrics class are done now and should test their environment using the following steps.**

    Test whether everything installed correctly by typing in a command prompt::

        ipython notebook

    Your default browser should fire up. If you get a ``UnicodeDecodeError``, most likely your computer name contains special characters. Assuming you are on Windows, do the following:

        * Type sysdm.cpl into the start menu search box
        * Change your computer name to pure ASCII characters
        * Restart

    Click on "New notebook" and type::

        import sys
        sys.version

    followed by "Shift + Enter". It should say::

        '3.4.1 |Anaconda ... '

    If it does not, you need to modify your path settings, moving Anaconda first.

    Then type::

        import statsmodels as sm

    If no error occurred, you are done!
